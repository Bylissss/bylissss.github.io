# My Linux Experince

It's all started with a repository, that i look after watching MVG's video on Ocarina of Time decompilation. There while I looked at README.md some think stuck on my mind. Under the Building section, instructions for Windows is just installing some thing called WSL and continue from Linux section.

## WSL

Funnily installation was easy at my first try.
Prompt come for username and password and I'm in. Try some random commands I remember from some video tutorials and holy shit it's actually works. Begin to wonder can i compile something wait how do I open text editor even oh wait there was something they joke about what was it called oh yeah vim type it and see the tips in middle of the program which :q to exit :h to help which for was funny after seeing all those can't exit vim memes all over the programmer humor pages. Actual problem was I cannot type anything to file itself randomly begin to press everything on keyboard and it works I wrote a hello world program in c save it. Run gcc it runs. I get curious and begin look internet to a gui , copy paste a command that I have no idea what I does and I broke it. Freezed force fully shut down and just begin to show an error when tried to open for long time didn't have access to it until I learn you can download it from MS's website.

## Cygwing

See it on other projects never make it work and after learned other alternatives were superior never touched.

## Mingw

While I was learning about Linux on Windows I see the name of it. Downloaded from SourceForge run after selected everything wait for download, open CMD write ls and didn't work I tried to do to same but no avail, eventually forgot about. Until about 2 weeks later see in my C drive turns out it did work I just did think if worked would have added to path but no after manually adding it to PATH
finally works.

## TempleOS?

Okay even at time I knew this wasn't Linux and made by a guy with schizophrenia and messiah complex who also was a computer genius. RIP TERRY DAVIS. Seriously this dude write his own programming language named Holy C, to write his own OS named TempleOS with mental illness, and not like social media "mental disorders", because God said so. I can barely write something works without a mental illness.

Now about the OS itself. I just bored one midnight and see his video of writing a CIA letter. After quick research I learn about who he is and what he did. Downloaded Virtual Box and OS, which was only 15mb if I remember correctly, and it works, sort of. UI is ugly and blindingly white, no idea what even looking at. I managed to open game which have no idea what it was, and I guess file from source code of OS.

## Ubuntu

While I was looking Terry Davis's video latest version of Ubuntu was downloading on back after my thinkering with TempleOS finished, it runned perfectly. i do the installation thinker with settings ,again compiled a simple hello world program. By the way VMs are insanely heavy, while using Virtual Box my computer turned into a plane and begin to fly inside the home. Anyway after the sucsess i downloaded program i seen on internet for making a bootle USB. balenaEtcher for some reason freezes and crashes late stage of writing. USB didn't work and just threw me into GRUB safe mode where i had no idea what to do and manually shut down the computer. After while i found another program for the job Rufus it seemingly worked, pluged USB and and aaannd. We're in, desktop opens i deal language, accesiblity, keyboard next come to the where to put the OS come i just choose option for dual-booting with Windows and that didn't work and intaller exited. From my point of view i have no idea i'm doing some thing called live-session where turns out whole OS is on ram and when needed reads from USB. Time gets late and i eventually close laptop.

When i returned i was expecting eveything to be worked without USB, i was wrong first while booting ubuntu wasn't even on the list. I was expecting with error something got corrupted and writen to disk but no disk only had Windows stuff in it. Turns out you can't just directly cut file system of Windows whatever you want. First you need to open utility Disk Managment and select drive and shirink. That give me 80gb of space for Ubuntu next i tried (didnt end)

## Maybe Arch next?
